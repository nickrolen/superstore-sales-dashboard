- **Top 10 Products**: Quickly see which products drive the most revenue.
- **Sales by Region**: Highlight which geographic areas outperform.
- **Sales by Category/Sub-Category**: Understand category-level trends (for example, Technology leads).
- **YoY Growth by Region**: Analyze year-over-year growth to spot volatility or momentum.
- **Key Findings**: Summary of actionable insights included.
